								<h2>About Me</h2>
							</header>

							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/aboutmeimage.jpg" alt="" width="600" /></a>
							<p>
							I graduated from Granby High School in the advanced studies program. During high school I found 
							a passion for photography and I was able to participate in exhibitions at the Hermitage Museum 
							and the Scope. I also had the opportunity to have one of my poems published (don’t ask, it was 
							awkward and angst filled and if I am lucky, all copies have been destroyed).
							</p>
							<p>
							After graduating from high school, I joined the United States Marine Corps. I wish I could say 
							it had been out of a sense of civic duty or responsibility. But the truth was a sense of adventure 
							and a desire to travel away from home. Training in MCRD Parris Island, Camp Lejeune, and Fort 
							Jackson and then to Camp Kinser in Okinawa Japan and finishing up in MCB Quantico, Virginia. It was 
							a learning and growing experience. The training, the structure, and the leadership. I learnt the 
							difference between following and leading and what it takes to be a leader as well as responsibility 
							as both a follower and a leader of Marines.
							</p>
							<p>
							After leaving the Marines, it was an easy transition to the Norfolk Sheriff’s Office. The training 
							was in line with previous training I had had in the Corps. The structure was less formal than the 
							hierarchy of the military and introduced me to being not only a civilian but a leader amongst 
							civilians. I had the opportunity to gain management and leadership experience while running floors 
							in the jail and as a PROBE team leader. While I have an appreciation for the organization and enjoyed 
							working with many of my peers, the nature of the jail and law enforcement was beyond my expectations. 
							I decided a career change was in order and started attending college.
							</p>
							<p>
							I graduated from Tidewater Community College with a major in computer science and transferred to Old 
							Dominion University to pursue my bachelor’s degree. While attending ODU I had the opportunity to 
							attend my first hackathon, Develop Hampton Roads. I used the experience and knowledge to help ODU 
							host its own hackathon. One of the sponsors of the ODU event was the campus Association of Computing 
							Machinery, of which I became the president. Another sponsor was the Strome Entrepreneurial Center, 
							for whom I am now employed as a student worker.
							</p>
							
							<p>
							<h3>Old Dominion University Extracurriculars</h3>
							<ol>
							<li>
							In March 2015, I chaired and helped organize Old Dominion University's first 
							<a href="https://www.odu.edu/news/2015/3/hackathon#.VU9kH_lVhBf">hackathon</a>. 
							</li>
							<li>
							In April 2015, I <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-7bfO6H6bAG__jiAvzKJc9ReKTMkj9XxQrEm1BNX5EU/edit?usp=sharing">
							presented</a> and took first place at the 2015 Spring Simulation Multi-Conference,
							an international model and simulation conference. The app, developed in conjunction with 
							Eastern Virginia Medical School and Norfolk State University, took first. 
							</li>
							<li>
							Chaired the fall 2015 Old Dominion University collegiate hackathon, Monarchs Hack the Campus. 
							Unfortunately the event was canceled when Old Dominion University closed the campus due to 
							expected flooding from Hurricane Joaquin. 
							</li>
							</ol>
